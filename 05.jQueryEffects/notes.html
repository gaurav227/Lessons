.hide()
The first tool you will add to your jQuery effects tool belt is the .hide() method. When you hide an element, your browser will render the HTML as if the hidden element does not exist.
It will disappear from the page and the space that it was taking up will disappear as well. Take a look at the code below to learn how to use the .hide() method:

.show()
Now that we've learned how to hide elements on our page, we want to know how to make them reappear.
Luckily, the .show() method does the opposite of .hide(). If an element on your page is hidden, .show() will make it appear.

.toggle()
Great work! Our table now has two buttons that hide and show our image. But wouldn't it be nice to have one button do both?
It is common for web pages to have one button that will either hide or show elements depending on their current state. We can achieve this by using the .toggle() method.

/*
$(document).ready(() => {
  $('.hide-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.first-image').hide();
  });

  $('.show-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.first-image').show();
  });

  $('.toggle-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.first-image').toggle()
  });

});

fading
In this gif, the .fadeIn() method is called on an HTML element. Instead of instantly showing the element, .fadeIn() and .fadeOut() make the element appear or disappear over a given period of time.
You can think of this as an animation. The transition between being visible and invisible happens over a duration of time.

Both .fadeIn() and .fadeOut() take an optional parameter that specifies how long the animation will take.
For example, in the code below, all <div> elements will fade out over a period of 1000 milliseconds (or one second).

  /*
  $(document).ready(() => {
    $('.hide-button').on('click', () => {
      $('.first-image').hide();
    });

    $('.show-button').on('click', () => {
      $('.first-image').show();
    });

    $('.toggle-button').on('click', () => {
      $('.first-image').toggle();
    });

    $('.fade-out-button').on('click', () => {
      $('.fade-image').fadeOut(500)
    });

    $('.fade-in-button').on('click', () => {
      $('.fade-image').fadeIn(4000)
    });

  });
  */


  .fadeToggle()
  Great work! With fade, our website is starting to look dynamic. .fadeToggle() is the third and final method in this trio of fade methods.
  This method is similar to .toggle(). If you call .fadeToggle() on an element that is invisible, it will fade in. And if the element is already visible, then .fadeToggle() will make it fade out.

  Like the other fade methods, .fadeToggle() can take an argument that sets the duration of the effect.

/*
$(document).ready(() => {
  $('.hide-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.first-image').hide();
  });

  $('.show-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.first-image').show();
  });

  $('.toggle-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.first-image').toggle();
  });

  $('.fade-out-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.fade-image').fadeOut(500);
  });

  $('.fade-in-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.fade-image').fadeIn(4000);
  });

  $('.fade-toggle-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.fade-image').fadeToggle('fast');
  });
});
*/


Sliding
Have you ever been to a website and seen HTML elements slide into place? Many websites use this effect to show menus; you click on your profile image and a menu slides down revealing different settings and options that you can change.
These sites are likely using jQuery sliding effects.

By using sliding effects, an element on your web page will slide up or down into place instead of appearing or disappearing. Just like with the other effects, sliding can be applied to any element on your page whether it be an image, a video, or text.

Sliding methods are animations; they happen over a period of time. As a result, sliding methods have an optional parameter to determine how long the animation will take.

/*
$(document).ready(() => {
  $('.hide-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.first-image').hide();
  });

  $('.show-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.first-image').show();
  });

  $('.toggle-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.first-image').toggle();
  });

  $('.fade-out-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.fade-image').fadeOut(500);
  });

  $('.fade-in-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.fade-image').fadeIn(4000);
  });

  $('.fade-toggle-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.fade-image').fadeToggle();
  });

  $('.up-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.slide-image').slideUp(100);
  });

  $('.down-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.slide-image').slideDown('slow')
  });

  $('.slide-toggle-button').on('click', () => {
    $('.slide-image').slideToggle(400)
  });

});

Review: Effects
Wow! You've completed this table of 9 different jQuery effects. Great job! To review, the methods that we learned were:

.hide()
.show()
.toggle()
These methods instantly hide or show elements on a web page.

.fadeOut()
.fadeIn()
.fadeToggle()
These methods make elements disappear or appear over a given period of time.

.slideUp()
.slideDown()
.slideToggle()
These methods make elements slide up or down into place over a given period of time.

Using these effects, you can make your web pages eye-catching and dynamic. And thanks to the magic of jQuery all of this can be done with very few lines of code!
